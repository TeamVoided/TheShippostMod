# The ShipPost Mod

The silliest and the goofiest features you count ever want in this game.

# What the mod?

The ShipPost mod is a very simple and silly mod that adds all the nonsense we at team voided can come up with. Like
craftable skeletons, netherite sticks and many more.

We would advise against using this mod in a long term worlds or servers. Some features in this mod are very broken and
some are very overpowered, this all is of course by design as this mod is just silly ideas.

As of the current version (0.1.0) there is no way of disabling the features in this mod, but the future plan is to have
everything be fully configurable, so you can pick and chose what funny's you want and what should be thrown in to the
void.

# Da Future

As of the current moment, there ate about 60 more ideas that we have written down and that will be added to the mod in
the future so if you like the absolute tomfoolery of this mod you will be happy to hear that there will be even more.
